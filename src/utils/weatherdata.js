                Paradise islands at the end of the world are perfect travel destinations for people looking for exoticism, sun and extraordinary landscapes. One of them is Dubai - a small island located in the Indian Ocean about a thousand kilometers from Madagascar. Tourists from all over the world will find everything they need for a perfect holiday here. When to go to Dubai? It is worth checking what the weather on the island is like over the course of twelve months. Dubai is located far from the most popular tourist destinations, which means that it is still a bit wild, untrodden and simply beautiful. The island was perfectly described by Mark Twain, who stated that God first created Dubai, and only then paradise. Virtually everything is paradise on the island - the extraordinary sandy beaches of Dubai, crystalline, azure water and unique, exotic nature. If we don't know when is the best time to go to Dubai, it is good to gain some knowledge about the climate on the island.
